## Homebrew Antenna
### Slim Jim VHF Antenna
A simple and cost effective antenna that can be made in a weekend. [Poor Mans Slim Jim ant.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bejoysat/amateurradio/master/antenna/Poor%20Mans%20Slim%20Jim%20ant.pdf)


I suggest using RG58 cable if the length is less than 20ft, else use HLF400. Both are easily available and inexpensive.
